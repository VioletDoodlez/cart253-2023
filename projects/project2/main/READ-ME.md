My Final Project is a game that centers around tuning a tv during a snowstorm, and picking the right channel. I wanted my game to have an easy going premise, with simple mechanics and gameplay. The idea came from listening to one of my favourite Vaporwave musical artist, vcr-classique. I wanted the players to feel at ease when playing the game, so I included a Christmas themed background (mostly due to my holiday spirit) and some background ambience of a snowstorm and a fireplace. Because I was mainly inspired by 80s media, . I included some of vcr-classique's music as background tracks to some of the channels, a reference to one of my favourite 80s inspired games which I played recently, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and my favourite 80s cartoon, Jem and the Holograms. The icons at the top left corner are emojis, meant to represent each of the 7 channels. This gives the player a goal and as well as a reason to explore the different channels. In the right corner of the screen, there is a pop up menu that allows the player to access the controls. Originally, I had them as their own separate screen, but after talking with some friends, they suggested I find a way to have the player access the instrustions and controls during the game to avoid making them memorize all of it.
